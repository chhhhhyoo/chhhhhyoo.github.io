# Project Overview

This project focuses on building a modular **Fashion Recommendation System** using deep learning and computer vision techniques.

**Key Objectives:**
- Classify clothing images into defined categories.
- Recommend visually similar clothing based on learned features.
- Visualize model decision-making to ensure interpretability.

# Technologies Used

- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV (image preprocessing)
- Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
- Grad-CAM (model explainability)

# ðŸ› Main System Components

## 1. Image Preprocessing

- **Bounding Box Cropping**: Focus on the clothing item by cropping using provided (x1, y1, x2, y2) coordinates.
- **Resizing**: Standardized resized dimensions (224Ã—224).
- **Normalization**: Mean subtraction and scaling aligned with ImageNet standards.

## 2. Model Architectures

### (A) Transfer Learning with ResNet50V2
- Pretrained on ImageNet; fine-tuned from deeper layers (e.g., after layer 150).
- Classification head structure:
  - GlobalAveragePooling â†’ Dense(256) â†’ Dropout â†’ Dense(128) â†’ Dropout â†’ Softmax (6 classes).

### (B) Inception-ResNet Hybrid
- Introduced Inception modules after initial convolutions.
- Combined with customized ResNet bottleneck blocks to capture multi-scale features.

## 3. Recommendation Mechanisms

### (A) Category-Based Recommendation
- Predict clothing category.
- Recommend items belonging to the same predicted category.

### (B) Content-Based Recommendation
- Extract feature embeddings from the model.
- Retrieve top-K visually similar items using cosine similarity.

## 4. Model Explainability

- **Grad-CAM** overlay heatmaps are used to visualize where the model focuses during predictions.
- Confirmed model attention is on meaningful garment regions (e.g., sleeves, collars).

# Achievements

| Area | Achievement |
|:---|:---|
| Preprocessing | Consistent bounding box handling, resizing, and normalization. |
| Model Upgrades | Improved accuracy via Inception-enhanced ResNet50V2. |
| Training Optimization | Switched to TensorFlow's `tf.data` pipeline for 30% faster training. |
| Interpretability | Built Grad-CAM visualization for explainable predictions. |
| Recommendation Features | Implemented both category and content-based recommendation strategies. |

# Key Results

- **Validation Accuracy**: Significant improvement after fine-tuning pretrained models.
- **Training Speed**: 30% faster after pipeline optimizations.
- **Explainability**: Grad-CAM heatmaps validated model's attention to relevant clothing regions.

# Lessons Learned

## Model Development
- Transfer learning reduces training time and boosts initial performance.
- Deeper fine-tuning leads to better domain adaptation (fashion images vs. general ImageNet).

## Data Engineering
- Efficient data pipelines are critical for rapid iteration and larger batch training.

## Model Evaluation
- Grad-CAM is vital for real-world model debugging beyond academic interest.

## System Design
- Separating category classification and content similarity enhances recommendation system versatility.

# Conclusion

This baseline version delivers a fully working, modular fashion recommendation system capable of:
- Predicting clothing categories.
- Recommending visually similar alternatives.
- Explaining model decisions through visualization.

This foundation sets the stage for future improvements such as real-time serving, user personalization, and fashion e-commerce integration.
